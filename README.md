#visualinternetDE VIDE

Using blockly, a visual programming language from Google, combined with common front-end web frameworks, VIDE is a 'wysiwyg-like' editor that is aimed at lowering the bars to web development. Instead of referencing a table of HTML tags and framework parts, blockly provides these elements through it's visual programming style. Additionally, since the entire development stack is on the web, this means there's no downtime switching between editors and compiling.
